# Health Coaching Conversations (for AI)

![Health Coaching](/header.png)

## Introduction

This project is a collection of conversation samples between professional health coaches and their clients. This data can be used with Large Language Models (LLMs) as one- or many-shot examples, or as data for fine-tuning, to replicate the behavior and performance of a qualified health coach.

## Creation Method

All conversations were synthetically generated by one or more LLMs, and passed through multiple automated reviews to ensure that conversations adhere to coaching best practices and did not contain irrelevant or inappropriate content.

## Data Organization

100 conversations as arrays of messages in JSON format, stored in the [/conversations](/conversations/) folder. The [topic-index.md](/topic-index.md) file groups the JSON files by category and provides a brief description of each conversation for easy reference.

## Conversation Structure

- The _client_ is labeled as `user`.
- The _coach_ is labeled as `assistant`.
- Conversations begin with a request by the `user` and end with a response from the `assistant`.
