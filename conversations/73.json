		},
		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": "Using household items as visual guides for portion sizes can simplify the process. For instance, visualize a portion of cheese as the size of a thumb. It’s about making it practical and easy for you. Does this approach seem manageable for you?"

Observing your food, its taste, and texture can immerse you in the experience. Flexibility in how you apply mindful eating, especially during busy times, is important. Does beginning with these small steps seem achievable?"
		},
