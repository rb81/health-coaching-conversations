			"content": "Using appropriate storage methods can significantly extend the freshness of your vegetables. For leafy greens, keeping them dry and storing them in air-tight containers lined with paper towels can help. Firm vegetables like carrots and celery can be stored in water to keep them crisp. Regularly checking your fridge for any vegetables that need to be used up can also prevent waste and keep your selection fresh."
